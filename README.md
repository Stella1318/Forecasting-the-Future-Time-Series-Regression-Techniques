## Regression on Time Series

### `Regression_onTimeseries.ipynb`

This notebook focuses on performing regression analysis on time series data. The main sections and highlights of the notebook include:

- **Introduction**: 
  - An overview of the objectives and the importance of regression analysis in time series data.
  - Brief explanation of the dataset used, including its source and key features.

- **Data Import and Exploration**:
  - Steps to load the time series dataset into the notebook.
  - Preliminary exploration of the dataset, including checking for missing values and understanding the structure of the data.
  - Visualization of the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and any apparent patterns.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Techniques to handle missing data, if any, such as interpolation or forward filling.
  - Transformation of the data to ensure stationarity, which might include differencing or logarithmic transformations.
  - Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the regression models.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Creation of lag features and rolling statistics to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.
  - Generation of additional time-based features such as day of the week, month, or quarter to enhance the predictive power of the models.

- **Model Selection and Training**:
  - Introduction to various regression models suitable for time series data, such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
  - Training each model on the prepared dataset and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluation of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
  - Comparison of model performance on the training and testing datasets to identify the best-performing model.
  - Visualization of the predictions versus actual values to assess the fit of the models.

- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - Application of more sophisticated time series regression techniques such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or Prophet, if applicable.
  - Discussion on model assumptions and diagnostics to ensure the validity of the results.

- **Results and Insights**:
  - Summary of the findings from the regression analysis.
  - Insights derived from the models, including key patterns and trends identified in the time series data.
  - Discussion on the limitations of the analysis and potential areas for future work.

- **Conclusion**:
  - Recap of the objectives and main findings from the notebook.
  - Reflection on the importance of regression analysis in time series forecasting and its applications in various domains.

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to time series regression analysis, combining theoretical explanations with practical implementations. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding how to handle and model time series data effectively.
